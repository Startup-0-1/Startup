Version: v0.1.0-ui-complete
Date: 12/17/2025
Scope: UI Architecture + Local Development Stabilization

Summary:
Completed a full UI refactor and finalized a deterministic local development
workflow. This milestone establishes a clean visual system, consistent layout
architecture, and a reliable Docker-backed environment. The project is now
ready to move from presentation-layer work to core domain hardening.

Major Changes:
- Migrated all templates to Tailwind-based layouts
- Introduced standardized layout structure:
  - ui/layout_public.html (public + auth)
  - ui/layout_app.html (authenticated app)
- Removed legacy core/base.html usage across all templates
- Restyled all core user, doctor, appointment, payment, and settings pages
- Unified UI components (forms, tables, status pages)
- Fixed template inheritance and block structure issues
- Ensured consistent navigation and URL resolution across roles

Infrastructure & Tooling:
- Dockerized Postgres and Redis for local development
- Resolved port conflicts via explicit host/container mapping
- Integrated django-environ for environment-based configuration
- Verified Tailwind build pipeline and static asset resolution

Documentation:
- Updated README.md with an authoritative, step-by-step run guide
- Documented first-time setup vs daily development workflows
- Clarified project status and next development phase

Verification Checklist:
- All pages load without template errors
- No templates extend legacy base.html
- Tailwind styles compile and hot-reload correctly
- Django connects successfully to Dockerized Postgres
- Patient and doctor flows render correctly end-to-end
- Payment success and cancel pages render as expected

Known Tradeoffs:
- Welcome page currently uses public layout shell for authenticated users
  (intentional simplification; can be upgraded to a shell layout later)
- Admin UI remains Django Admin (custom admin UI deferred)

Next Phase:
Step 3A — Scheduling Hardening
- Prevent double booking
- Enforce timezone-safe scheduling
- Add database-level constraints
- Prepare scheduling layer for external provider integrations (e.g., NHS)

Notes:
This commit represents a structural milestone. No feature development should
proceed until this state is stable. Future commits should build on this
baseline rather than modify it retroactively.
